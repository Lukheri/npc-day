Everything I do is a team of one. \n\nResearch, planning, filming & editing for the videos is all done 100% by myself. \n\nSame goes for planning, hosting, & summarizing the governance calls.\n\nOne thing I hope to do with RPGF funds is to hire a video editor so that I can increase the quantity & quality of my educational content.",
